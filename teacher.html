        <h2>Text 1: The Social Media Debate</h2>

        <div class="context">
            <strong>Context:</strong> The following is an excerpt from a school board meeting discussion about social
            media regulation.
        </div>

        <div class="argument-text">
            <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, we should ban all social media platforms for teenagers under 16. Let me tell you
                what happened to <span class="fallacy">my neighbor's son, Marcus. He was a straight-A student until he
                    got an Instagram account last year. Within six months, his grades dropped from an A to a C.</span> I
                watched it happen right before my eyes. His mother told me he was spending hours and hours scrolling
                through his feed, looking at other people's perfect lives. <span class="fallacy">Clearly, social media
                    is destroying our youth's academic potential and mental health.</span></p>

            <p>Furthermore, <span class="fallacy">every responsible parent I know agrees that social media is
                    harmful.</span> Last week at my book club, all eight parents nodded their heads when I brought this
                up. Not a single one disagreed. That's what I call a consensus. <span class="fallacy">And these aren't
                    just any parents—these are educated, professional people who care deeply about their
                    children.</span></p>

            <p>Now, I know some of you might hesitate on this ban, but let me be clear: <span class="fallacy">if you
                    don't support this ban, you obviously don't care about children's education and well-being. There's
                    simply no other explanation for opposing such a common-sense measure.</span> Everyone knows that
                protecting children is our top priority, so <span class="fallacy">anyone who votes against this is
                    clearly not putting children first.</span></p>

            <p>I've also been looking at the research, and while I'm not a scientist myself, I can tell you that <span
                    class="fallacy">studies show correlation between social media use and depression. Correlation means
                    causation in this case—it's obvious.</span> Anyone with common sense can see that social media
                causes these problems. We need to act now before we lose an entire generation to their phones."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-box">
            <h3>Detailed Fallacy Analysis</h3>

            <div class="annotation">
                <p><span class="fallacy-type">Anecdotal Evidence</span> <span class="fallacy-type">Hasty
                        Generalization</span></p>
                <p><strong>Text:</strong> "my neighbor's son, Marcus...his grades dropped from an A to a C"</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The speaker uses a single example to support a sweeping policy affecting
                    all teenagers. One student's experience cannot establish causation or represent the experiences of
                    all teenagers. There could be numerous confounding variables (family issues, health problems,
                    academic difficulty, etc.) that weren't considered.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="annotation">
                <p><span class="fallacy-type">False Cause (Post Hoc)</span></p>
                <p><strong>Text:</strong> "Correlation means causation in this case—it's obvious"</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The speaker explicitly commits the correlation-causation fallacy. Just
                    because social media use and depression occur together doesn't mean one causes the other. There
                    could be reverse causation (depressed teens use social media more) or a third variable (family
                    stress, academic pressure, social isolation) causing both.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="annotation">
                <p><span class="fallacy-type">Appeal to Popularity</span> <span class="fallacy-type">Bandwagon</span>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Text:</strong> "every responsible parent I know agrees that social media is harmful"</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This attempts to validate the argument by citing popular agreement.
                    However, the phrase "responsible parent" stacks the deck—it implies that any parent who disagrees is
                    irresponsible. Additionally, eight parents at a book club is not a representative sample.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="annotation">
                <p><span class="fallacy-type">Ad Hominem</span> <span class="fallacy-type">Questioning Motives</span>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Text:</strong> "if you don't support this ban, you obviously don't care about children's
                    education and well-being"</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Rather than addressing counterarguments, the speaker attacks the character
                    and motives of opponents. This is a classic ad hominem—you can care about children AND have concerns
                    about how a ban would be implemented, enforced, or whether it's the best solution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="annotation">
                <p><span class="fallacy-type">False Dilemma</span></p>
                <p><strong>Text:</strong> "anyone who votes against this is clearly not putting children first"</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This presents only two options: support the ban or don't care about
                    children. This ignores many other positions (education about responsible use, parental controls,
                    age-appropriate restrictions, etc.) and many reasons to oppose a total ban while still prioritizing
                    child welfare.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="summary">
            <h3>Summary of Logical Problems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Relies on single anecdote rather than systematic evidence</li>
                <li>Confuses correlation with causation</li>
                <li>Uses emotional manipulation and character attacks instead of logical argumentation</li>
                <li>Presents false choice between total ban and not caring about children</li>
                <li>Cherry-picks agreement from a non-representative sample</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong class="key-point">Better Approach:</strong> Cite peer-reviewed research, acknowledge complexity
                of the issue, present evidence-based interventions, and address counterarguments respectfully without
                questioning motives.</p>

        <h2>Quick Reference: Fallacy Types Found in These Texts</h2>

        <div class="analysis-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ad Hominem:</strong> Attacking the person instead of their argument</li>
                <li><strong>Appeal to Authority (Inappropriate):</strong> Citing experts outside their field of
                    expertise</li>
                <li><strong>Appeal to Tradition:</strong> Assuming old practices are correct because they're old</li>
                <li><strong>Appeal to Popularity:</strong> Assuming something is true because many people believe it
                </li>
                <li><strong>Appeal to Uncertainty:</strong> Claiming that because science isn't 100% certain, we can't
                    trust it</li>
                <li><strong>Anecdotal Evidence:</strong> Using personal stories as proof instead of systematic evidence
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cherry Picking:</strong> Selecting only favorable evidence while ignoring contradictory
                    evidence</li>
                <li><strong>False Cause (Post Hoc):</strong> Assuming correlation implies causation</li>
                <li><strong>False Dilemma:</strong> Presenting only two options when more exist</li>
                <li><strong>False Analogy:</strong> Comparing two things that aren't actually comparable</li>
                <li><strong>Hasty Generalization:</strong> Drawing broad conclusions from insufficient evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong> Claiming one action will inevitably lead to extreme consequences
                </li>
                <li><strong>Genetic Fallacy:</strong> Dismissing arguments based on their origin rather than their merit
