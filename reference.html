            <h2>📚 What Are Logical Fallacies?</h2>
            <p>Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument. They often seem
                persuasive and can be emotionally compelling, but they don't hold up under logical scrutiny.
                Understanding fallacies helps you evaluate arguments critically and construct stronger arguments
                yourself.</p>

                <p>Science progresses by updating knowledge based on new evidence—this is a strength, not a weakness.
                    Perfect certainty is rarely achievable, but that doesn't mean all claims are equally uncertain. We
                    can have high confidence in well-supported conclusions even if we don't have absolute certainty.</p>

            <h3>🎯 Final Tips for Identifying Fallacies</h3>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li><strong>Separate the claim from the reasoning:</strong> Ask "What conclusion are they drawing?" and
                    "What evidence supports it?"</li>
                <li><strong>Look for emotional language:</strong> Strong emotions can mask weak logic</li>
                <li><strong>Check for missing steps:</strong> Good arguments explain WHY the evidence supports the
                    conclusion</li>
                <li><strong>Consider alternative explanations:</strong> If other explanations exist, the argument may be
                    oversimplified</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for pressure tactics:</strong> "Everyone agrees," "You'd be foolish not to," etc.
                    often signal weak arguments</li>
                <li><strong>Ask for specifics:</strong> Vague claims about "studies" or "experts" may hide weak evidence
                </li>
            </ul>
